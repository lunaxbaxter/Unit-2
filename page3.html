<h1>Releasing Pets Into The Wild</h1>
  <h2> What We Can Do </h2>
  <h4> There is always something better to do than to release you pet into the wild. Even if you don't think that you one goldfish will change the enviorment, thats what other people think too, and its better to be safe than sorry. Listen below, I have up with different ways to move on without your pet that doesnt invole dumping.</h4>
  <h4> Aquarium Fish. This list can include goldfish, koi, guppies, beta fish, tetras and many more. Instead of dumping them into a near by river, lake, pond, you can kindly ask a friend or family member if they want them. Another option is to go by a pet store. This isn't always a soild choice, just because if you have a common goldfish, they will most likely say no, but its still worth a shop. Still haven't found a taker? That's okay, try posting on Craigslist,or fish hobbiest stite, surely somewill want them.</h4>
  <h4> Got any reptiles you don't want? Again, start by asking a friend or family member if they want a new pet. Reptiles are alot more likely to be taken then fish, so posting them on Craigslist or taking them to pet stores are a good idea. Not all animal shelters/SPCAs will take reptiles, but if you can find a good no kill shelter, I would definitely recommend doing that. </h4>
  <h> Have any pet birds? Animal shelters and SPCAs will deffintly take these in, unless of course, they are too full. Asking friends and family members is always an idea for a smart noggin, but if its more of an exotic bird posting on websites like "BirdsNow.com" will tend to attract bird enthusiasts. </h4>
