<h1>Overview
  <h3> Many people around the world release their house pets into the wild, many times causing problems with the natural environment that they now inhabit. Whether it be an exotic pet or a simple goldfish, both parties of animals cause problems to the animals we endanger, and eventually, maybe not directly, ourselves.

<h3> As you can tell, from this picture obtained by the website,Independent, the average size of a pet goldfish, much smaller than the ones found in an Australian river, is a great example of why we shouldn't release our goldfish into the wild.
  <h3> Many people belive that the basic goldfish, the ones we all had as a child, stay small forever. This common misconception is just not true. When goldfish have a massive amount of space, their growth doesn't stay stunted, and they grow into ginormous fish, sometimes reaching around 4.5 pounds with a length of 30 cm.
