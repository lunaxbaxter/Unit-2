<h1>Hello World, I am Bella
  <p> Eclectus parrots are very cute</p>
  <h2> The males and females look very different</h2>
  <h3> I personally think that the males are cuter, because I like the colors better </h3>
  <h3> So if I were to get one it would be a male </h3>
  <h2> The cool thing about them is that they arent one person based </h2>
  <h4> They live for a reasonable amount of time, not like eighty years, which is cool </h4>
