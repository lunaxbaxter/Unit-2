  <h1>Releasing Pets Into The Wild</h1>
  <h2> What Can Happen To The Animals </h2>
  <h4>Although it, of course, doesn't happen one hundred percent of the time, there are cases where the animal that has been let loose manages to survive on its own and reproduce.</h3>
  <h4>In these rare cases where the animal survives and establishes themselves in a non-native environment or ecosystems, they become known as an invasive species. According to the National Invasive Species Information Center or the NISIC, an invasive species is defined and can be any non-native plant, animal or pathogen that establishes itself in the surrounding ecosystem.</h4>
  <h4>When the invasive species repopulates and its population becomes steady and unwavering, it causing stress in its living habitats and can even wipe out or severely damage indigenous species that were there before it. </h4>
  <h4> Posted below is a picture of a ferret being released into the wild. This particular ferret was a black-footed ferret, a breed that is wild. Black-footed ferrets are capable of living in the wild, being wild animals of course, yet because of this many ex ferret owns believe that their domesticated ferrets will be able to survive too. This simply is not true. The ferrets that humans keep as pets were domesticated by humans as early as 63 BCE. They don't have the same survival instincts and shouldnâ€™t be confused with the black-footed wild ferret. If a domesticated ferret is turned loose into the wild, it is very likely they won't survive more than a few days.</h4>
