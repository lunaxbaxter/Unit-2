  <h1> Releasing Pets Into The Wild </h1>
  <h2> Why It Matters</h2>
  <h4> Each time we buy, adopt, somehow obtain an animal, its life ultimately falls under our care and it's our job to give it the best life possible. It's very common for people to people to abandon fish, mice and rats, frogs, snakes, and other reptiles into the environment. All of these animals, although maybe not as affectionate as a dog or as wise as a horse, are still living animals that all strive to survive. Animals as a whole don't give up easily, and especially domesticated animals tend to suffer when abandoned in the wild. </h4>
  <h4> Not only does the specific animal suffer, the animals around them can suffer too. Say for example, a mass quantity of snakes were relased from a breeder and a small percent of them managed to survive and pass on their genes. Overtime, as the population of that specises increased, they will take over resources, space, and may even pose a direct threat to the indigenous aniamls. </h4>
