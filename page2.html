<h1>Another parrot that I think would be amazing to have is a Blue Fronted Amazon.
  <p> They too, are amazing and cool</p>
  <h2> But they cost around $1,000 then the Eclectus, so I doubt I'll be able to get one</h2>
  <h3> My parents don't want a parrot, so I doubt I'll be able to get a multi thousand dollar bird. </h3>
  <h3> Blue fronted Amazons are live for a while longer than eclectuses, so I wouldnt want to have a life long companion and then die first.  </h3>
  <h2> I've heard that Blue Fronted parrots are alot picker than other Amazons </h2>
  <h4> But they were kind of what got be into parrots, so I cnt't throw them under the bus now</h4>
